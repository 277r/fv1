move common definitions to libav_include.hpp
add readme with compilation guide
use linker directly instead of using g++ when building target build/static

allow encoder to store frames on disk in temporary folder until framestream can be created

iostream -> iosfwd maybe

C frame compression (known to other people as i frames)
design BI frame

when encoder and decoder are finished:
fix bit_layout_reworked documentation
scan encode(), decode() for memory leaks (especially when returning errors)

update framestream_extraction(..) so it has set length and will never segfault except when video stream
upate decode.cpp so it actually can supply a zero, current formula has a minimum of 1

for C frames:
	design them (duhh, see rule 11)
	split the video in blocks of 16, then half every time so the blocks stay 16x16


for RI frames:
	add lookback option (compare to last N frames), add memory option (to store N frames that have been seen multiple times already, circular overwrite list)
	make comparison function for frame_test that checks in amount of different blocks
